Got it ðŸ‘Œ let me walk you through the flow step by step (no image, just explanation):

ðŸ”¹ Project Flow

Admin Actions

Admin logs into a simple dashboard (protected route).

From there, they can:

Create a container â†’ Fill in title, thumbnail (upload or URL), social links.

Edit a container â†’ Update details (maybe replace thumbnail or links).

Delete a container â†’ Remove it entirely.

These actions call your backend API (POST, PUT, DELETE) which updates the database.

Database

Each "container" (post) is stored with fields like:

{
  "title": "My Program",
  "thumbnail": "https://cdn.com/thumb.jpg",
  "links": [
    { "platform": "YouTube", "url": "https://youtu.be/..." },
    { "platform": "Instagram", "url": "https://insta.com/..." }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-08-19T10:00:00Z"
}


Only admin has write permissions. Visitors only fetch data.

Visitor Flow

A visitor opens your frontend (React app).

The frontend calls the backendâ€™s GET endpoint â†’ fetches all containers.

The data is displayed as cards/containers: thumbnail + title + links.

Visitor can only view & click links, no login required.

Frontend Responsibilities

Public page â†’ Shows all containers in a nice grid.

Admin dashboard (hidden route, like /admin) â†’ Contains forms for CRUD actions.

Visitors never see admin tools.

Deployment

Frontend â†’ static hosting (Netlify/Vercel).

Backend â†’ Node/Express deployed on Render/Railway.

Database â†’ MongoDB Atlas or PostgreSQL.

Image storage (if uploading thumbnails) â†’ Cloudinary or AWS S3.

ðŸ‘‰ So in short:

Admin â†’ CRUD via backend â†’ DB updated

Visitors â†’ frontend fetch (GET) â†’ DB read-only

Would you like me to also suggest a minimal backend API design (just the routes and their purpose, no code)? That way youâ€™ll know exactly what endpoints to build.
